**TeluguScript** is a programming language designed to honor **Telugu Talli** and celebrate the beauty of the Telugu language in the programming world. It is a transpiler that converts Telugu syntax into JavaScript, making coding an expressive and meaningful experience for Telugu-speaking developers.

With **TeluguScript**, developers can write code in Telugu, using native Telugu words as keywords and syntax. This allows for a deeper connection to the language while coding, making the development process more inclusive and culturally rich.
See [official documentation](https://github.com/vankaSiddhartha/TeluguScript/tree/main/documentation).

## Features

## Special Mention
I was inspired by **TempleOS** created by **Terry A. Davis**. While I may not be as legendary as him, I share the same extreme passion for computer science that he had. His unique vision and dedication to his craft serve as a constant reminder of what can be achieved when you follow your passion.
