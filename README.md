**TeluguScript** is a programming language designed to honor **Telugu Talli** and celebrate the beauty of the Telugu language in the programming world. It is a transpiler that converts Telugu syntax into JavaScript, making coding an expressive and meaningful experience for Telugu-speaking developers.

With **TeluguScript**, developers can write code in Telugu, using native Telugu words as keywords and syntax. This allows for a deeper connection to the language while coding, making the development process more inclusive and culturally rich.
See [official documentation](https://github.com/vankaSiddhartha/TeluguScript/tree/main/documentation).

## Features

- **Expressive Programming**: Write code using Telugu keywords and syntax
- **Easy to Learn**: TeluguScript's syntax is simple and intuitive, especially for native Telugu speakers
- **JavaScript Transpiler**: Converts TeluguScript code into JavaScript for execution
- **Procedural Programming Support**: Currently supports procedural programming paradigms
- **Npm Installable**: Easy installation via npm

## Installation

Install TeluguScript using npm:

```bash
npm install teluguscript
```


## Planned Language Enhancements

We are actively working on expanding TeluguScript's capabilities:
- Syntax highlighting support
- Enhanced code editor integration
- Advanced programming paradigm support
- Improved transpilation techniques
- Richer language constructs and keywords

## Special Mention
I was inspired by **TempleOS** created by **Terry A. Davis**. While I may not be as legendary as him, I share the same extreme passion for computer science that he had. His unique vision and dedication to his craft serve as a constant reminder of what can be achieved when you follow your passion.
